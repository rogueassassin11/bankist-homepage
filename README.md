Complete JavaScript Course 2020 Project 5 - Bankist Homepage

This is a course project I coded alongside the Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: From Zero to Expert" by Jonas Schmedtmann. It is a fictional home page about a minimalist banking application. This was used to teach Advanced DOM Manipulations.
